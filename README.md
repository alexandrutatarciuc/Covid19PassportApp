# Covid19PassportApp
 
I decided to stop enduring the effects of the pandemic and start to act. Besides keeping a solitary life style and respecting all the means of protection against the new virus, I decided to make use of my skills and create a COVID-19 Passport Vaccine for citizens, which will be inevitably implemented in future.

   * Display of the passport
   * Option of adding a passport
   * Generation of QR which contains the ID of the document
   * Display of the taken COVID-19 tests
   * Option of adding taken COVID-19 tests

Should have:
   * Log in option
   * Changing language preferences
   
Could have:
   * Graphs that will display statistics regarding COVID-19 cases
   * Option of advising the user to take a test in days with unusual high amount of cases

Won't have:
   * Loging in using NemID
   * Retrieving information from Sundhed
   * Option of deleting the passport
   * Account management
