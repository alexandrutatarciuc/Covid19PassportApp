# Covid19PassportApp
 
I decided to stop enduring the effects of the pandemic and start to act. Besides keeping a solitary life style and respecting all the means of protection against the new virus, I decided to make use of my skills and create a COVID-19 Passport Vaccine for citizens, which will be inevitably implemented in future.
